# Block-Programming-Platformer

Prototype created for a pre-college game design course at Parsons School of Design

In the game, the player controls a robot through platforming puzzles with 'programmable' objects 
The player uses collectable 'code chunks' to program the objects, giving basic directions such as movement to the objects, as well as basic coding concepts such as loops.

The intention is to teach players basic coding concepts, by familiarizing them with block programming using the puzzles
